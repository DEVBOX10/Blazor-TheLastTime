        <div><span style="font-family: 'Caveat', cursive; font-size: 1.5em;">ididit! </span> is a habit tracking app that doesn't make you feel bad and helps you stay on track.</div>

        <ul>
            <li>Instead of a streak, there is an average interval - you aren't punished for breaking a streak, you are encouraged to keep the average interval close to the desired interval.</li>
            <li>Instead of reminders, the app shows you how close to the average interval you are - there are no nagging alarms that you dismiss and forget about anyway.</li>
            <li>The app is fully customizable - you can turn any of it's many features on or off.</li>
            <li>The app is completely private - it uses no cookies, nothing is sent back to the web server and it works offline.</li>
